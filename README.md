# Odin-Landing-Page

This is a lesson project from The Odin Project to demonstrate my understanding of CSS styling and flexbox usage. It will contain some basic placeholder texts and containers for a landing page.

In this project, I used a lot of different aspects of flexbox and learned how to move things around and situate placeholders. Liberal use of margins and padding, as well as learning how to utilize percentages was critical for this project.
